React Hooks
=====
  Available from React 16.8.
  They let you use state and other React features without writing a class comp.
  Features that were available only in class comp are 
  now available with the help of hooks in functional comp also.

  Many features available to class comp such as lifecycle hooks and states are now possible in fn comp 

  Hooks enable fn comp to have states in it.
